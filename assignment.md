* *[Verse 1: Mina, Jeongyeon]*

A little reckless around the edges
Call it young, dumb love and it's just enough
Keep me guessing (Keep me guessing)
How the story unfolds with you (You)
When I’m walking into the darkness
I know you'll be right there, lighting up the flares
When it's starless
I will follow you to the moon (Moon, ayy) 
***
* *[Pre-Chorus: Dahyun, Momo]*

No, we’ll never fall apart (Never fall apart)
Even million miles apart (Million miles apart)
We were lightning from the start (Lightning from the start)
And it keeps me going to know that
***
* *[Chorus: Nayeon, Tzuyu]*

Ooh
No matter what, you got me
I got you
And I wouldn't want it any other way
Ooh
No drop of doubt, I know deep down that
We'll make it through (It through)
Just like we always do
***
* *[Verse 2: Chaeyoung, Sana, Jihyo]*

Ayy
Every second, every minute
Want you close to me like you're supposed to be
Ain't no limit (Ain't no limit), to what I would do for you
Oh, oh
And you know, you turn my whole world upside down
Catch me before I ever hit the ground
And I'd do the same for you
Oh, woah
***
* *[Pre-Chorus: Momo, Dahyun]*

No, we'll never fall apart (No, we’ll never fall a–)
Even million miles apart (Even million miles a–)
We were lightning from the start (We were lightning from the)
And it keeps me going to know that
***
* *[Chorus: Sana, Nayeon, Jihyo]*

Ooh
No matter what, you got me
I got you
And I wouldn’t want it any other way
Ooh
No drop of doubt, I know deep down that (No drop of doubt, I know deep down that)
We'll make it through (Make it through)
Just like we always do
***
* *[Post-Chorus: All, Nayeon]*

**Do-do-do, do-do, do-do, do, do
Do-do-do, do-do, do-do, do, do
Do-do-do, do-do, do-do, do, do
Oh-oh**
***
* *[Chorus: Mina, Jihyo, Nayeon]*

Ooh
No matter what, you got me
I got you
And I wouldn’t want it any other way
Ooh
No drop of doubt, I know deep down that (No drop of doubt, I know deep down that)
We'll make it through (Through)
Just like we always do
***
* *[Post-Chorus: All, Jeongyeon, Tzuyu, Chaeyoung]*

**Do-do-do, do-do, do-do, do, do (That we do)
Do-do-do, do-do, do-do, do, do (We do)
Do-do-do, do-do, do-do, do, do**
Just like we always do
